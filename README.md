# Sales Analysis Report

## Problem Statement:
In a fintech company, employees received data via email every hour. A dedicated team of 10 resources was responsible for downloading this data, cleaning and processing it, identifying any data issues, and consolidating all the hourly data. They created visually appealing Excel reports and manually sent these reports to relevant stakeholders. This manual process was time-consuming and resource-intensive, significantly impacting the organization's efficiency.


## Problem Solution:
To address these challenges, the company decided to migrate to Power BI. The project aims to automate the data handling process by leveraging Power BI to fetch email attachments directly without manually opening each email. These attachments, which could be in various formats such as Excel, CSV, PDF, or JSON, will be cleaned, combined, and visualized in Power BI dashboards. The automated process will then send these dashboards to stakeholders, including managers, team leaders, clients, or any end-users.
This project will cover the end-to-end implementation of Power BI, demonstrating how to streamline data collection, processing, and visualization, thereby reducing the time and effort required and enhancing overall organizational efficiency.

##  Note:
1.	As this is a demo project, snapshots of the initial steps will not be included; however, the procedure will be clearly explained.
2.	Requires Power BI Desktop version.
3.	Requires a corporate email ID.
4.	To replicate the project, follow these steps:
            •	Copy the folder “Data” from GitHub.
            •	Ensure the required dependencies are installed.
            •	Set up the necessary configurations.
